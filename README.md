- entire screen represents colony
- ANSI chars represents colony workers
- workers creates wast web of wire connections
- they also can remove wire to get space to move

Levels

- each time worker places wire it can level up
- each deconstruction can decrese level
- levels are represented by shade of the sprite (darker == higher)
- at the highest level worker become "one with universe", can't move and can't be destroyed
- but can be regenerated by other workers (both gets regerneration)
- worker that gets below level 1 dies forever


## Example

![life cycle](https://i.imgur.com/wWMDNut.png)

- size 12x12
- time 8000 cycles

## Settings

I'm still tweaking them but only a little bit. Those valueas are in percent of 100.

- BUILD CHANCE = 20
- DESTROY CHANCE = 20
- DECRESE CHANCE = 30
- INCRESE CHANCE = 30
- REGENERATE CHANCE = 50
