First stage of simulation

- ANSI chars represents "ants"
- ants can create "pipes"
- and connect them to create a bigger grid
- also if they collide/stuck they can destroy pipes

Levels

- each creation can increse ant level
- each destruction can decrese ant level
- levels are represented by shade of the sprite (darker == higher)
- at the highest level ant become "one with universe", can't move and can't be destroyed
- but those ones can be regenerated by other ants (both backs to the original state)
- ant that gets below level 1 dies forever
