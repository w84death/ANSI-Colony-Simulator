Ants now can create "pipes" and connect them to create a bigger grid. Also if they collide/stuck they can destroy pipes.

Each creation can increse ant to the higher level.

Each destruction can decrese ant level.

Levels now do nothing beside changing sprite (char).

At the highest level ant become a "wall". Can't move and can't be destroyed. Other ant when interacting can regenerate both the other one and self to the initial state.
